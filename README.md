Dissertation Title: NON-TRANSIENT ANOMALIES DETECTION (NTAD) ARCHITECTURE FOR SECURITY AND FIRE LIFE SAFETY INSPECTION
GOAL
•	The dissertation aims to build an architecture based on computer-vision techniques to automate security and safety inspection.
•	Develop a system that can detect and identify potential fire hazards and suspicious objects quickly and accurately.
SIGNIFICANT

–	Achieve safety in the work environment
–	Creating alertness before the situation turns into an emergency
–	 Help in the effective management of trained human resource 
–	Reduction of terrorist attack
–	Protection of life and properties in the public domain
–	Improve security in the public spaces

HYPOTHESIS
•	A safety architecture can be designed to automate the detection of abandoned or suspicious objects.
•	The same foundational safety architecture can perform fire and life safety inspections  more frequently, more thoroughly, and more effectively while requiring fewer human resources
•	The same foundational safety architecture can be used to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks in the public domain.

OBJECTIVE
•	Build an automatic safety Inspection algorithm for inspecting Commercial buildings using a computer-vision-based approach and machine learning.
•	Address the critical challenge of manual safety inspection in a commercial building.
•	Explore computer vision applications that can accurately detect abandoned objects and automate fire safety critical inspection. 
•	Develop a CV-based safety architecture that can increase safety in the public domain and mitigate terrorist attacks. 

•	A safety architecture can be designed to automate the detection of abandoned or suspicious objects.

CONTRIBUTION
●	Proposed Non-Transient Anomalies Detection (NTAD) architecture to address the challenge of manual safety inspection in commercial buildings through automation
●	Proposed architecture that addresses abandoned object detection in a manner suitable for deployment on edge devices
●	Detailed analysis of computer vision-based approaches for abandoned objects and fire life safety inspection  
●	Demonstrated that proposed architecture handles extreme illumination changes for AOD as stated in current literature
●	 Demonstrated the versatility of the proposed architecture to apply to other fire life safety activities, such as automated detection of missing ceiling tiles
